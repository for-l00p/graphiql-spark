## What & Why?

GraphiQL Spark allows you to run queries or mutations completely client side! In addition the query/mutation response is rendered once GraphiQL is mounted, which makes it ideal for blog posts.

**_Note_:** Out of the box GraphiQL requires you to press the `play` button to run the query and see the results.

### How is it different to GraphiQL?

Not by much. GraphiQL Spark is thin convinience layer on top of GraphiQL.

### Benefits

- No Downtime (your static site might work, but the GraphQL endpoint might be down)
- No Server Cost (why pay for demoing a GraphQL concept on your blog?)
- Faster feedback loop (no network request)

### Downsides

- Requires the packages `graphql` & `graphl-tool` which adds ~64kb (minified + gzipped) to the bundle.

## Install

```bash
# npm
npm install --save graphiql-spark
# yarn
yarn add graphiql-spark
```
